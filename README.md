I'm glad you're here! 

I believe that creative collaboration between design and technology is the magic that takes experiences from good to great. In my journey, I've experienced the world of SEO, where I've learned a lot about good web development practices and recently I got a UX Design certification, which I achieved through a scholarship 100% funded by Google. I've been sharing my journey as an Informatic and Computer Engineer Student on LinkedIn and here you can check my latest projects!

- Currently:

BSc in Informatics and Computing Engineering @ FEUP
